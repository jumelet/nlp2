### Programming

- IBM1
    - ~~currently training~~
    - plot training log-likelihood and AER
- IBM2 
    - initialisations
        1. ~~uniform~~
        2. ~~random (with 3 different seeds)~~
        3. ~~with a run of IBM1 (see Collin's notes)~~
    - train
    - plot training log-likelihood and AER
- Neural IBM
    - complete `neuralibm1.py`
    - train
    - plot training log-likelihood and AER
- Evaluate IBM 1, IBM 2, Neural IBM with test data


### Paper

- introduction: present the problem and relevant background
- model: technical description of models


### Experiments

- initialisations
- error analysis
    - POS tags
        - source POS --> target POS 
        - sequences of POS for which errors are frequent
    - Investigate `NULL` tokens
