### Programming

- IBM1: currently training
- IBM2 
    - initialisations
        1. uniform
        2. random (with 3 different seeds)
        3. with a run of IBM1 (see Collin's notes)
    - train
- Neural IBM
    - complete `neuralibm1.py`
    - train
- Evaluate IBM 1, IBM 2, Neural IBM with test data

### Paper

- introduction: present the problem and relevant background
- model: technical description of models


### Experiments

- initialisations
- error analysis
    - POS tags
        - source POS --> target POS 
        - sequences of POS for which errors are frequent
